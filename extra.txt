loop 1000 simulations
    Generate demands
        gets demands for each store
        gets new cost for each route
        based off new generated duration.
    loop through optimal routes
        check if theyre still valid
            if so add to list of routes
        if not valid
            add store to list of dropped stores
            add route (without dropped store to routes)
        if there are 2 or more dropped stores
            solve for optimal routes
            get costs for generated routes
        one store
            add to list of routes
        zero stores 
            do nothing
        sum costs
        add cost to list of optimal costs
